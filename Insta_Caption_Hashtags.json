It is exciting, interesting and fun to explore. Cauliflower can imitate rice, mashed potatoes, chicken nuggets, pizza crust, honestly try to find something it isnt. Yesterday I had cauliflower taco meat Chickpeas act as a cookie dough and black beans make the best brownies ever! Sweet potatoes can be toast, avocados make amazing ice cream and bananas make a killer pancake The best part is these substitutes add more nutrition, reduce sugar and are so filling I can not believe this cheesecake was made with cottage cheese! Reaping all the benefits of protein and a huge reduction in fat. A real recipe win 1 cup Greek Yogurt 2 1/3 Cottage cheese 2 eggs 1/2 cup maple syrup 2 tsp flour 1/2 vanilla pod or 1 tsp vanilla extract Blend yogurt and cottage cheese in a blender until smooth Beat eggs with flour and maple syrup Add vanilla and mix with cheese mixture Pour onto graham crust In spring form pan with parchment paper (I used a regular 8x8 pan and made cheesecake squares) and bake for 1 hour at 350 Cool 10 minutes to room temperature and set in fridge 40 minutes to form Recipe from @theworktop What food item do you use in a different / unique way?",

Check out which greens can help you maintain a healthy diet. - Iron Meat = soybeans, lentil, spinach, Swiss chard, turnip (combine with food rich in vitamin C to get double effect) - Calcium Dairy = collards, cabbage, bok choy, kale - Omega 3 (healthy fats) Salmon = kale (a cup of contains 121mg of Omega 3 and 92.4 of Omega 6 On top of that greens strengthen the blood and respiratory system and help to fill up alkaline minerals in our bodies which is beneficial for people live in polluted areas. However, it is important to eat some greens in moderation as they are high in oxalic acid (Spinach, Swiss chard) which prevents calcium absorption.",

Our chefs creatively adapt age old recipes and heritage cuisines so the food can be both delicious and nutritious for many different dietary needs.
