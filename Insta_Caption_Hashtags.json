Yesterday I had cauliflower taco meat\n\nChickpeas act as a cookie dough and black beans make the best brownies ever! \n\nSweet potatoes can be toast, avocados make amazing ice cream and bananas make a killer pancake \n\nThe best part is these substitutes add more nutrition, reduce sugar and are so filling \n\nI can not believe this cheesecake was made with cottage cheese! Reaping all the benefits of protein and a huge reduction in fat.\n\nA real recipe win \n\n1 cup Greek Yogurt\n2 1/3 Cottage cheese\n2 eggs\n1/2 cup maple syrup \n2 tsp flour \n1/2 vanilla pod or 1 tsp vanilla extract\n\nBlend yogurt and cottage cheese in a blender until smooth \nBeat eggs with flour  and maple syrup \nAdd vanilla and mix with cheese mixture \nPour onto graham crust In spring form pan with parchment paper (I used a regular 8x8 pan and made cheesecake squares) and bake for 1 hour at 350 \n\nCool 10 minutes to room temperature and set in fridge 40 minutes to form \n\nRecipe from @theworktop \n\nWhat food item do you use in a different / unique way? \n\n#cheesecake #bakinghealthy #healthydesserts #foodsubstitutes #cottagecheeserecipe #cottagecheese #nutrition #proteinrecipe #protein #cheese #dessert #healthycheesecake",
